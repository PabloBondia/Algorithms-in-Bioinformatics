# Algorithms-in-Bioinformatics

This repository contains a collection of computational biology projects focusing on sequence alignment, phylogenetics, and protein structure prediction. These projects were developed as part of an advanced bioinformatics course and involve the implementation of fundamental algorithms in biological sequence analysis.

Each project adheres to formal algorithmic methodologies and computational techniques widely used in bioinformatics research.
