Sequence Alignment using Dynamic Programming

Description

This project implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for optimal sequence alignment using dynamic programming. It computes the maximum alignment score between two sequences based on a given substitution matrix and a gap penalty.

Features

Uses a customizable substitution matrix for scoring matches and mismatches.

Implements gap penalties to handle insertions and deletions.

Fills a dynamic programming table to compute the optimal alignment score.

Can be extended to reconstruct the aligned sequences through backtracking.

Usage

Define two sequences that need to be aligned.

Specify the substitution matrix and gap penalty.

Run the algorithm to compute the optimal alignment score.

(Optional) Implement backtracking to retrieve the aligned sequences.
